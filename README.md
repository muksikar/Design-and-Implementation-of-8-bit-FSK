# Design-and-Implementation-of-8-bit-FSK
Designed and simulated an 8-bit Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation system using Multisim. • Analyzed and verified FSK output waveforms for different input bit patterns through simulation. Implemented the FSK circuit on hardware and validated the practical output against simulation results
